# Cart Pole Simulator

### How to use
run `python3 cart_poly.py [kp] [ki] [kd]` in your terminal window. You can play around with different
and see the resulting simulation.    

Another important parameter is `u_max` which is defined in the code. This is the maximum input the the system 
can provide. Having a large calue of `u_max` is less realistic, as most real world systems cannot generate 
very large forces on the cart.
